    "##### Answer 1: It takes all possible combination and choose the one with best accuracy.GridSearchCV is a hyperparameter tuning technique that is used to find the best hyperparameters for a model. It is an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid. It is used to find the best hyperparameters for a model by evaluating the model's performance on a validation set for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid. The grid search algorithm works by training the model on the training data with each combination of hyperparameters in the grid and evaluating the model's performance on the validation data. The hyperparameters that give the best performance on the validation data are selected as the best hyperparameters for the model."

    "Answer 2 : GridSearchCV is an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid, while RandomizedSearchCV is a random search over a specified parameter grid. GridSearchCV evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters in the grid, while RandomizedSearchCV evaluates a random sample of hyperparameters from the grid. GridSearchCV is computationally expensive and can take a long time to run, while RandomizedSearchCV is less computationally expensive and can run faster. GridSearchCV is best suited for small parameter grids, while RandomizedSearchCV is best suited for large parameter grids. GridSearchCV is best suited for finding the best hyperparameters for a model, while RandomizedSearchCV is best suited for finding good hyperparameters for a model.\n",

    "Answer 3- Data leakage is a problem in machine learning where information from the training data is used to make predictions on the test data, leading to inflated performance metrics and inaccurate model evaluation. Data leakage can occur when the training data contains information that is not available in the test data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization of the model. Data leakage can also occur when the training data contains information that is not available in the real-world data, leading to poor performance of the model in production. "

It shows the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by the model. A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance on the test data, allowing you to evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It helps you to understand how well the model is performing and identify areas where the model can be improved."

    "Answer 6- Precision and recall are two important metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. It measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances in the test data. It measures the ability of the model to identify all positive instances in the test data. Precision and recall are inversely related, meaning that as precision increases, recall decreases, and vice versa. A high precision value indicates that the model is making accurate positive predictions, while a high recall value indicates that the model is identifying all positive instances in the test data."

It measures the overall performance of the model on the test data. The values in the confusion matrix, such as true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, are used to calculate the accuracy of the model. The accuracy of a model is influenced by the values in the confusion matrix, such as the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model. A high accuracy value indicates that the model is making accurate predictions on the test data, while a low accuracy value indicates that the model is making incorrect predictions on the test data. By analyzing the values in the confusion matrix, you can determine the accuracy of the model and identify areas where the model can be improved."
