    "Answer 1: # Linear regression is used to predict the continuous dependent variable. It establishes the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is represented by the equation Y=a+bX+e. Logistic regression is used to predict the categorical dependent variable. It is used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular category. It is represented by the equation Y=1/(1+e^-(a+bX)). Logistic regression is more appropriate when the dependent variable is binary or categorical. For example, to predict whether a student will pass or fail in an exam based on the number of hours studied, logistic regression would be more appropriate."

    "Answer 2: # The cost function used in logistic regression is the log loss function. It is defined as J(θ) = -1/m ∑[y(i)log(hθ(x(i))) + (1-y(i))log(1-hθ(x(i)))] where hθ(x) = 1/(1+e^-(θ^T x)). The cost function is optimized using gradient descent. The gradient descent algorithm is used to minimize the cost function by updating the parameters θ in the direction of the steepest descent. The parameters are updated iteratively using the formula θ = θ - α ∇J(θ) where α is the learning rate and ∇J(θ) is the gradient of the cost function."

    "Answer 3: # Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in logistic regression. It adds a penalty term to the cost function to discourage the model from learning complex patterns that may not generalize well to unseen data. There are two types of regularization: L1 regularization and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function, while L2 regularization adds the squared values of the coefficients. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients and encouraging the model to learn simpler patterns that generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "L1 regularization is also user for feature selection.\n",
    "L2 reularization is also known as Ridge regression and is use to reduce overfitting."

    "Answer 4: # The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classification model. It plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different threshold values. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model. AUC ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better-performing model. An AUC of 0.5 indicates a random model, while an AUC of 1 indicates a perfect model. The ROC curve helps visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity and choose an appropriate threshold value for the logistic regression model."
